The $\lambda$-calculus is a formal system, capable of expressing the
computational process.  Because of it's simplicity and expressiveness, this
calculus is used as a theorical model for the paradigm of functional
programming. Consequently, a great variety of extensions was proposed, with
the goal of obtaining an intermediate formal system between the
$\lambda$-calculus and its implementations.  The object of study of this
work is one of these variants, called $\lambda$ex, a calculus with explicit
subsititutions, proposed by Delia Kesner. The goal was to continue the work
in the formalization of this calculus, in the Coq proof assistant, initiated
in 2014, with the goal of providing a mechanical and constructive proof of
the strong normalization property for the $\lambda ex$ calculus. More
specifically, we began the proof of the IE property, key to the
demonstration of the preservation of strong normalization of the $\lambda
ex$-calculus.
