Lambda calculus is a formal system of logic, capable of expressing the computational process.
Because of it's simplicity and expressiveness, this calculus is used as a theorical model
for functional languages and proof assistants. Consequently, a great variety of variants
was proposed, many of them trying to develop a closer model to the pratical implementations
of the aforementioned languages and tools.
The object of study of this work is one of these variants, called $\lambda$ex, 
a calculus with explicit subsititutions, proposed by Delia Kesner.
In short, the goal is to continue the work in the formalization of this calculus, 
in the Coq proof assistant, initiated in \cite{initial}, in order to
enunciate it's definitions and theorems on a language that allows these to be automatically
verified by an algorithm.
In particular, the focus is the proof of the calculus' confluence.
